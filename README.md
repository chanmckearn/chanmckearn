- I'm Chan McKearn and I have a 47' catamaran sailboat.  I'm using Open Plotter as a open source navigation program and I'm having some problems getting it to work completely.  It runs now but I need some help making the correct connections.  All of my instruments are connected to an NMEA 2000 backbone and are fed to the Raspberry Pi 4 with Open Plotter on it through an Actisense NGT-1 converter to a USB port in the RPi 4.  The status bar at the bottom of the chart plotter shows information like the boat location, COG, SOG, etc.  but it is dark grey letters on a light grey background and it's very hard to read in the sunlight.  How do I change the background of that status bar in Open Plotter or Open CPN?
I have other issues I'm trying to solve in Open Plotter too, but I need to make contact with someone who is familiar with this program in order to explain what I'm trying to do.
